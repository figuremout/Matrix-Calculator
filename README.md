# Matrix-Calculator
Thought came from the boredom of linear algebra.

A small console program written in C helps to perform some basic matrix operations.
The original version is just one 'main.c 'file, which all functions are put in.
And many potential problems still exist though it can run correctly, cause my level is really limited for now.
